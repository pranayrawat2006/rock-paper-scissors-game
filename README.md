# Rock Paper Scissors (C++)

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game written in **C++**. It's my **first project** as a beginner, and I'm sharing it as part of my coding journey.

## ðŸŽ® How it works
- The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer randomly chooses its move.
- The result (Win/Lose/Draw) is displayed based on standard RPS rules.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Randomized computer choices
- Clear game result output
- Basic input validation

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard libraries: `iostream`, `cstdlib`, `ctime`

## ðŸš€ Future Plans
- Add score tracking
- Add replay option
- Make it GUI-based in future (maybe using SFML or Qt)

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback
This is a small project, but Iâ€™m open to suggestions to improve it. Iâ€™m still learning and would love feedback from the community!
